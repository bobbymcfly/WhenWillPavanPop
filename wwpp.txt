Background: 
On August 5th, 2012, the goon squad was posted up like a mailbox at 4 Corners a/k/a Etna 2.0 and exchanging the usual bakwaas and pointless, semi-witty banter.

Naturally, Pavan's future marriage inevitiably became the topic of discussion. For those of you unfamiliar with Pavan (the protangonist a/k/a "young fresh"), I strongly encourage you to educate yourself:

Anyways, Mr. 714, Tapan, and Prashant discussed the bets they had placed against one another on what year Pavan was going to propose to Ms. Lady (the deuteragonist). With the exception of Pavan, the other individuals in the room were intrigued, perplexed, and excited about the wager. Talks continued about raising the stakes, creating a moving line with odds and payouts, and involving more individuals.

Fast forword to June 2013: Pavan's brother's bachelor party in Chicago went off without a hitch, so it was about time appropriate time to address the elephant in the room - when will Pavan pop the question?

The Game: 
All particpants guess the exact date Pavan will pop the question to Ms. Lady a/k/a S**** G****. The closest guess wins all of the money.

Rules:
1. $100 per guess.
2. The closest guess based on absolute deviation from the exact proposal date wins.
3. Winner takes all of the money in the pot + the interest gained*. In the event of a tie, the winnings are split amongst all winners.
4. If the proposal never happens, then all money will be refunded to the provided pay-pal e-mail address.
5. If Ms. Lady proposes instead of Pavan, then all money will be refunded to the provided pay-pal e-mail address.
